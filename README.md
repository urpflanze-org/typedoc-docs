# Typedoc-Docs

## Motivations

This package comes from the need to generate documentation from a typescript project by applying a custom style.

As a first step I felt the need to simplify the file generated by the command

```bash
typedoc. --json <path/to/out-file.json>
```

In order to have a more readable result and therefore easier to manage.

The style is still tied to urpflances, but it could become an isolated package.

## Installation

Install with npm

```bash
npm i -D @urpflanze/typedoc-docs
```

add _generate-docs_ in your `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
    ...
    "generate-docs": "node_modules/.bin/generate-docs"
}
```

## Testing

After the generation you will have to change the value of the base tag if you want to test it locally

file `docs/index.html`
change

```html
<base href="/.../" />
```

to

```html
<base href="/" />
```

and run server in docs dir (for example: php -S localhost:8080)
